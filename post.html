		<h3>Heat Transfer tracking system</h3>

		<p>This was a project I started back in July 2020 when I first learned C++ as a part of my B.Tech. Project. I was the sole creator/developer of the project.
		<br>
		<br>
		The system stored sample data for a nanofluid - nanostructure domain, initially at rest at time t = 0. Boundary temperature conditions would be applied to the system at this time and the domain starts moving to its final state begins, with my system tracking the progress every ten seconds. 	<br>
		<br>
		Results are generated for a variety of domain structures, with varying compositions and temperatures. Results would be generated by the system in a CVS file format and automatically sent to the a graphing/plotting system such as Techplot with an interface for researchers to be able to view the results.
		<br>
		<br>
		Customers had the ability to view all their data with a dynamic search form, trend data, add notes to reports and even map their samples' physical location.
		<br>
		<br>
		I have been working on this system for the last two years and it is nearing completion and pending publication in a scientific journal.</p>
